# Area 15 : Run for your life!

Code demos with graphics:
  * completeMenu: It demomstrates the succession of screens, depending on the buttons the user presses. Functional components: 
    (All back buttons, profile button, e-shop button(, create your own level button), online co-op button(, lobby button, community levels button), exit) 
    
  * completeGameScreen: A small sample of the gameplay experience. The player is in a room, where there is a scientist approaching. There is also a cable material
    in the player's reach. He can interract with it by touching it. Then, he has the option to either add it in his inventory, or not. If he does, it will be in 
    the preview that he can see, by pressing the inventory icon in the bottom right. Every time the inventory preview is on, the game pauses, by assigning 0 to the
    speed of both beings in-screen. The same happens if a collision arises between them.
  All the above are located in folder Code/Screens/...
